## 📖 About

WebMob is an educational robotics project that brings together web technologies, Arduino, and 3D printing to create an interactive learning companion. Using a smartphone as the robot's "face," WebMob features expressive eyes, voice interaction, and engaging learning activities like math games and hand-gesture drawing.

**Current Status**: 📚 This repository is currently in its documentation phase. We're preparing comprehensive guides and design documentation before releasing the source code. Stay tuned!

## ✨ Features

- 🎭 **Expressive Robot Face** - Animated eyes with emotions (happy, sad, surprised, etc.)
- 🎤 **Voice Interaction** - Text-to-speech responses with character personality
- 📱 **Web-Based Interface** - No app installation required
- 🎮 **Interactive Games** - Math challenges and hand-gesture drawing
- 🔌 **Bluetooth Control** - Wireless communication with Arduino
- 🎨 **Beautiful Design System** - Following friendly minimalism principles
